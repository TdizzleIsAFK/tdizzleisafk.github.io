Mock hackathon

Objective: Build a financial platform for a broad audience

Idea: Finance-based web game where the user pilots a submarine that can only get to new areas by saving and investing. 

Themes = Subnautica = Dark and light blue, grey, light purple, orange, and (green?)

One page should be for the game while there are also pages for tracking your finances, making deposits, following financial news and information, and a part where you can add friends from your contacts. index.html is home page and has a button to play, 
but doesn't automatically make you play

Pages:
index
news
tracking
social

The product would be converted to mobile eventually
